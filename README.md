In a group of 4 created a terminal parabola game as the extension to the ARM11 Assembler and Emulator project that was done for the Computing Practical 1 module in Imperial College London. The game is similar to the popular game of worms where players have to shoot missiles in turns in order to win the game.

The game was made in a terminal using C language and all of the graphics are prinited using ASCII characters.
